// Package strategies implements the routing strategies used by the gateway.
//
// Available strategies:
//   - Single:        always routes to one configured target.
//   - Fallback:      tries targets in order, retrying on failure.
//   - LoadBalance:   distributes requests across targets by weight.
//   - Conditional:   routes based on request field matching rules.
//   - LeastLatency:  routes to the target with the lowest observed p50 latency.
//   - CostOptimized: routes to the cheapest catalog-priced target.
//   - ContentBased:  routes based on the textual content of prompt messages.
//   - ABTest:        weighted random traffic splitting across labelled variants.
